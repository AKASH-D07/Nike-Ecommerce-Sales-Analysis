🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Using Excel and Power Query, I cleaned and transformed 3 key datasets:

This step ensured the data was consistent, structured, and ready for analysis.

I built three fully interactive dashboards using Power BI:

Matrix table for hierarchical product analysis

Discount % vs Quantity Sold (Scatter Plot)

Category-wise profit margin KPIs

3️⃣ Customer Insights Dashboard

These dashboards enabled quick analysis and seamless data exploration.

📈 Key Metrics Analyzed
